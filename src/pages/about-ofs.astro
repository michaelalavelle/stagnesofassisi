    <h1>About the Secular Franciscan Order</h1>
    <p>
      The Secular Franciscan Order (OFS) is a worldwide community of lay women
      and men who seek to live the Gospel in the spirit of St. Francis of Assisi
      while remaining fully rooted in family life, work, and parish life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our charism is to follow Jesus in the footsteps of St. Francis: living
      simply, loving creation, serving those in need, and building peace through
      prayer and fraternity.
